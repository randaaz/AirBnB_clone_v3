# 0x05. AirBnB Clone - RESTful API

In this project, we have implemented a RESTful API for an AirBnB clone application
using Python and Flask. The API provides endpoints to perform CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various resources such as
States, Cities, Users, Places, Amenities, Reviews, and the link between
Place and Amenity objects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, we have gained understanding of the following concepts:

- REST API fundamentals
- API development with Flask
- Handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- HTTP methods for CRUD operations
- Requesting REST APIs

## Requirements

- All Python scripts should follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Documentation is mandatory for all modules, classes, and functions.
- Unit tests should be written using the `unittest` module.
- All files must be executable.
- Ensure that your code is well-documented, follows best practices, and is thoroughly tested.

## Setup

To install Flask, use the following command:

```bash
$ pip3 install Flask
